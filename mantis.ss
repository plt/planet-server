  ;; The mantis interaction functions go through a big kludge: all of mantis's
  ;; internal user creation, project update, etc functions are written in PHP
  ;; and I'd rather call them than port them to Scheme for better robustness.
  ;; This raises the question, though, of how to actually call PHP from Scheme
  ;; code. The solution I came up with was to write a PHP wrapper (pointed to
  ;; by MANTIS-INTERFACE-COMMAND-LINE) that gets run as a unix process whenever
  ;; Scheme wants to call in to PHP. The data to send are always strings that do
  ;; not contain newlines, so they're sent one at a time over standard input. 
  ;; Why not pass them as command-line arguments? Because unprivileged users on
  ;; the machine that hosts planet would be able to see command-line arguments,
  ;; but can't see the contents of the input port.
  ;;
  ;; Anyway, this system is pretty nasty, but hopefully it'll hold up for the time
  ;; being. Probably the more robust way is to expose the functionality I want
  ;; as some kind of SOAP/XMLRPC/web-services something-or-other; if it becomes
  ;; important I'll do that.
