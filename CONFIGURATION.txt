CONFIGURATION.txt -- explanation of the planet server configuration
================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
The planet server as it is currently incarnated consists of
four major components:

1. A plt-web-server-text (or plt-web-server) instance, configured to
respond to requests that come in from the local host only, with the
contents of svn/iplt/planet/ in a directory accessible as
/servlets/planet/.

2. An Apache instance with PHP, mod_proxy and mod_rewrite, open to the
world.

3. A Mantis instance set up in a particular way: each planet user is
also a mantis user, each planet package is also a mantis project, and
each package owner in planet is also a project manager in mantis. The
user- and package-creation systems in planet maintain this invariant,
but the user creation system in mantis does not. For this reason you
should not create users or projects directly from Mantis.

4. A PostgresQL instance with the schema described in planet.psql
installed, and that mantis can use as well. It must be set up to
accept tcp connections that come in on localhost.

At a high level, requests come in to the Apache process. Apache is
configured to rewrite-and-proxy a normal page view or download request
to the plt-server instance running on localhost, and to send mantis
requests to the mantis code.
